UpdateTelemetry in ControlForm.pas now UpdateImages()

Graph updating code is now in its own procedure called UpdateGraphs()

Removed the LeftMotorOn and RightMotorOn flags in ControlForm.pas.

Now use SetLeftMotorPower, setRightMotorPower and SetBothMotorsPower for motor control.

'Swap motors' fucntionality is now implemented (Log data appears as L & R still but actual motor swapped)

SettingsForm - level detection now reads values from the selected left/right line sensors.

Replaced all MaskEdits on the SettingsForm with Edits and code to allow only backspace plus number keys as input.  Doesn't validate range but better.

Add analog button warning to the "Detect Level" buttons in the SettingsForm.

Reformat comments, long lines, and variable names in line with the Object Pascal Coding Standard.  See:  http://edn.embarcadero.com/article/10280

Set the HID device for this list item to be the just arrived device in HidDev in
the TSelectJoystickForm.HidCtlArrival method.

Changed the Buttons[] and LastButton[] arrays from integer {0,1} values to boolean values.  Now called ButtonPressed[] and LastButtonState[] respectively.  This makes the code easier to read.

The AnalogButton state variable in the SettingsForm was also updated from an integer to a boolean value.  Now called 'AnalogButtonOn'.
  
Removed the "ProcessMode" method.  Functionality is now spilt between two new procedures called CheckForBump and DriveOverSound.

Renamed "Form1" to "MainForm".
