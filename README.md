Telemetry and Code for the Suckerbot DIY Robot
==============================================

This is the control and telemetry code for [Suckerbot](http://www.tomtilley.net/projects/lollybot/) (now renamed "Lollybot") - my entry in the [African Robotics Network (AFRON)](http://robotics-africa.org) ["10 Dollar Robot" Design Challenge](http://robotics-africa.org/afron-design-challenges.html).

The code is written in Delphi and released under the GNU GPL v2 license.  There is also an alternate [HTML5 + JavaScript version of the code](https://github.com/Tominator2/lollybot) that runs in a web browser.
